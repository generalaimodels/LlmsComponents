### 8-bit Quantization

For 8-bit quantization in `bitsandbytes`, the process is typically as follows:

1. **Determine Quantization Range**:
   $$
   \text{Range}_{8\text{bit}} = 2^{8} - 1 = 255
   $$

2. **Quantize Weights**:

   \text{Quantized Weight}_{8\text{bit}} = \text{Round}\left(\frac{\text{Original Weight}}{\Delta_{8\text{bit}}}\right) \times \Delta_{8\text{bit}}
   $$
   where
   $$
   \Delta_{8\text{bit}} = \frac{\text{Max}_{\text{Original Weight}} - \text{Min}_{\text{Original Weight}}}{255}
   $$

3. **Post-Quantization Adjustments**:

   $$
   where

## trying mix the technique

Given the detailed explanation of various quantization techniques, we can devise a novel concept that could potentially enhance model efficiency, combining the strengths of the different approaches you've listed. Let's call this concept **Adaptive Mixed-Precision Quantization (AMPQ)**.

### **Adaptive Mixed-Precision Quantization (AMPQ)**

**Objective:**
To create an optimized quantization technique that adapts to the computational and memory constraints by dynamically adjusting the precision of weights and activations based on their sensitivity to quantization errors. This approach combines the strengths of mixed precision, adaptive quantization, and enhanced efficient quantization techniques.

#### **Core Components:**

1. **Dynamic Precision Scaling (DPS):**
   - **Concept:** Leveraging the ideas from **Marlin** (Mixed Precision Quantization) and **AWQ** (Adaptive Weight Quantization), DPS dynamically adjusts the precision (e.g., 4-bit, 8-bit, FP8) of weights and activations during runtime based on the sensitivity of each layer or parameter to quantization.
   - **Mathematical Representation:**
     $$
     \text{Quantized Weight}_{\text{AMPQ}} = 
     \begin{cases} 
     \text{Round}\left(\frac{\text{Original Weight} - \text{Min Weight}}{\text{Step Size}_{4\text{bit}}}\right) \times \text{Step Size}_{4\text{bit}} + \text{Min Weight} & \text{if sensitive} \\
     \text{Round}\left(\frac{\text{Original Weight} - \text{Min Weight}}{\text{Step Size}_{8\text{bit}}}\right) \times \text{Step Size}_{8\text{bit}} + \text{Min Weight} & \text{if less sensitive}
     \end{cases}
     $$
   - **Explanation:** Here, the quantization precision (4-bit or 8-bit) is selected based on the sensitivity of the weight to quantization error. This sensitivity could be determined through a pre-analysis phase where the impact of different quantization levels on model accuracy is evaluated.

2. **Enhanced Clipping and Bias Correction (ECB):**
   - **Concept:** Inspired by **EETQ** (Enhanced Efficient Quantization), ECB applies clipping and bias correction to minimize the quantization error, especially for outliers.
   - **Mathematical Representation:**
     $$
     \text{Quantized Weight}_{\text{ECB}} = \text{Clip}\left(\frac{\text{Original Weight} - \text{Bias}}{\Delta}\right) \times \Delta + \text{Bias}
     $$
   - **Explanation:** This ensures that the quantized weights are less susceptible to large quantization errors, particularly in cases where weights have a wide distribution with significant outliers.

3. **Safe Precision Loading (SPL):**
   - **Concept:** Leveraging **Safetensors** for secure and efficient weight loading, SPL ensures that the quantized weights are loaded efficiently while maintaining the integrity of the model.
   - **Mathematical Representation:**
     $$
     \text{Loaded Weight}_{\text{SPL}} = \text{Safe Load Function}(\text{Serialized Quantized Weight Data})
     $$
   - **Explanation:** This ensures that the quantized weights are safely loaded into memory, reducing the risk of data corruption or errors during the loading phase.

4. **Floating Point Quantization (FP8+):**
   - **Concept:** Extend the **FP8** (8-bit Floating Point) representation to include additional control over the exponent and mantissa, allowing for fine-tuned precision control.
   - **Mathematical Representation:**
     $$
     \text{FP8+ Representation} = \text{Sign} \times 2^{\text{Exponent}} \times \text{Mantissa}
     $$
   - **Explanation:** By tweaking the exponent and mantissa settings, FP8+ allows for a more flexible floating-point representation that can be adjusted to fit different layers or parameters' needs, balancing between precision and range.

#### **Implementation Workflow:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Model parameters are initially analyzed to determine their sensitivity to quantization.

2. **Precision Assignment:**
   - Using **Dynamic Precision Scaling (DPS)**, parameters are assigned either 4-bit, 8-bit, or FP8+ precision based on their sensitivity.

3. **Quantization with ECB:**
   - Quantized weights are further processed with **Enhanced Clipping and Bias Correction (ECB)** to minimize errors.

4. **Safe Loading:**
   - Quantized weights are then loaded into memory using **Safe Precision Loading (SPL)**, ensuring integrity and security.

5. **Runtime Adaptation:**
   - During inference, the model can dynamically adjust the precision of certain layers based on the current computational load or accuracy requirements, leveraging the mixed-precision approach.

#### **Advantages of AMPQ:**

- **Flexibility:** By combining multiple quantization techniques, AMPQ can adapt to a wide range of hardware constraints and performance requirements.
- **Efficiency:** The dynamic adjustment of precision allows for optimal use of computational resources while maintaining model accuracy.
- **Robustness:** Enhanced clipping and bias correction reduce the negative impact of quantization, especially for outliers.
- **Security:** Safe loading mechanisms ensure that model weights are not corrupted during deployment.

AMPQ represents a synthesis of cutting-edge quantization techniques, offering a versatile and powerful tool for optimizing deep learning models for deployment in resource-constrained environments.
